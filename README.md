# Manual_YakuzaDeadSouls_CFood

Heavily Recommend getting [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases/latest), as this will highlight what you can & can't do. A lot of this manual is built on gaining access to substories, scenario battles, & spec-ops via items.

### Win Conditions
* Golden Ball Hunt
  * There are 7 Golden Balls
* Substory Completion
  * Defined Selection from 1 - 60

If no conditions are turned on, the default is needing Kiryu, Kiryu's SBs, Grenades, and a Rocket Launcher. These are not required with any Win Condition turned on.

### Items
* Substory Access
* Spec-Ops Access
* Scenario Battle Access
* Progressive Weapon Upgrades
* Characters
* Completion Reward Items
  * Except Design Sources

As it sits, Substory Access is divided into sections while some are alone. "Livesavers Part 1-3" will unlock all three parts of that chain. "A Doctor in Danger" will be by itself however, even if it's in a chain with "Cliches".

### Locations
* Substories
* Spec-Ops
* Scenario Battles (called SBs in the manual)
* Karaoke-sanity
* Gary's Boot Camp
* Liberating Kamurocho
